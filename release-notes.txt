Fixed bug with default image zoom for page, eg if set to 120% it wouldn't work
Fixed bug with status bar text updating
Fixed conflicts with AIO Gestures, Mouse Gestures and Smooth Scroll
Changed "Zoom with Text" command key for english locale to be \ instead of Z. This was conflicting with the "undo" command key.
Added autofit function. Set imagezoom.showAutoFitInMenu in about:config to true to see this value in the main image zoom menu
